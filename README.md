####Time Management Tudor - Purpose

Time Management Tudor is .NET Framework and MVC CRUD app for helping students, or anyone, master the skill of time management. Using this experience to grow my knowledge of C#, javascript, Php and SQL.


#### Utilization

The idea for this app was born out of my tween boys'(6th and 8th grade) struggles with time management. Study skills is an area that schools don't spend enough time on. Their teachers can post homework and upcoming projects, tests and quizzes on the school web site and this information could be utilized to teach study skills: in this particular case, time management.

#### How it Works

- Create an account and log in
- Add, Edit and Delete events in calendar

#### Vision for future

- Add notifications
- Sync with school calendar
- Calculate 'free time' and assist with sketching out 'plans of action' idividualized according to student learning styles and schedule availability (i.e short(duration) time blocks of study that are scheduled more frequently vs.longer(duration) of time blocks for study that occur less frequently)
- Weekly notifications based loosely on the Agile premise, asking the questions;
    
        a) what did you accomplish last week?
        b) what do you need to add to this week?
        c) what do you need help with? 
- Add timer function to track time and set study breaks
